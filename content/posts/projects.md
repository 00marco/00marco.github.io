# 👋 Welcome to My Project Hub

Here's some non-NDA things I'm working on independently

---

## 🦝 [HeyRaccoon!](https://heyraccoon.com)

Feel like you need to cut down your screentime but not ready for a site blocker yet? Might want to try at least measuring things first

Status: ✅ MVP now available at [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/heyraccoon-browser-analyt/dpcgngcnhefnffoggbhllcnlnonnegfo)

## 🎨 [LazyArtist](https://lazyartistwebdemo-5mzkfvzu9w6xigwh7ffbcr.streamlit.app/)

What if you could just point a camera at yourself, focus on making art and have someone make reels for you?

Status: 🏗️ MVP ready for personal use (let me know if you're interested!)

## 👁️ [CompetitorMonitor](https://socmedstatsapp.streamlit.app/)
Want to see how your competitions' social media accounts are doing? Did they gain more followers recently? Are they doing a new campaign? Did they get cancelled?
